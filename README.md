# Cplusplus.Program Corner Grocer 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

The project is a simple object-oriented C++ program that imports a text file from a grocery store listing every sold item that day, backing it up to a output file and letting the user search the frequency a specific item was bought, seeing the frequency of all the items bought as well as printing a histogram of all the items bought. 

"The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. "

What did you do particularly well?

This was my first time working with maps and I was able to successfully move the information from the text file to the map with some research.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Because it was my first time using maps, I didn't know how to move the class to a seperate cpp and header file instead of having it in the main cpp file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging piece to write was the maps portion where I had to move all items to the map and count the frequency of each item. With a lot of trial and error and google searches I was able to figure it out. I particularly found past zyBooks chapters and Stack Overflow most helpful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Input validation and error handling are particularly important in a program. Having a program that doesn't crash when it doesn't get the expected input makes it easier for the end users of your code to use it correctly. Error handling helps in handling both hardware and software errors gracefully and helps execution to resume when interrupted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I added many comments that explained each step and used basic concepts. I forward declared functions for a more readable code and each block of code is organized and spaced out. The program can easily be expanded to do more or handle more imports.
